# Dart SDK Bazel Migration

This directory houses the active coordination, progress tracking, and developer guidelines for the ongoing migration of the Dart SDK build and packaging engine from GN+Ninja to Bazel.

---

## ⚡ Quick Start (Build & Run)

If you are a contributor (human or AI agent) looking to build or run the SDK using Bazel, here is what you need to know right now.

### 1. Host Prerequisites
Ensure your host machine has:
*   **Python 3** (used for minor helper scripts).
*   **Bazel** (recommended to use [bazelisk](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk) to automatically respect the [.bazelversion](../../.bazelversion) file).
*   **Xcode-select** (macOS only) or **MSVC** (Windows only) for native C++ compilation.
*   All third-party dependencies are fetched hermetically by Bazel via Bzlmod overlays. No manual sync scripts (like the retired `restore.sh`) are required.

### 2. Core Build Commands
Execute these from the repository root:

*   **Build the full, packaged Dart SDK:**
    ```bash
    bazel build //sdk:create_sdk
    ```
    This assembles the complete Dart SDK (binaries, snapshots, libraries) under `bazel-bin/sdk/create_sdk/dart-sdk/`.

*   **Build the standalone Dart VM:**
    ```bash
    bazel build //runtime/bin:dartvm
    ```
    This produces a self-contained `dartvm` binary at `bazel-bin/runtime/bin/dartvm` with all necessary dills and ICU data embedded hermetically from source.

### 3. Smoke Test (Verify the VM)
To verify your built VM works correctly, run a simple Dart script:

```bash
# Create a simple hello world script
cat > /tmp/hello.dart <<'EOF'
void main() {
  print('Hello from Bazel-built dartvm!');
  print([1, 2, 3].map((x) => x * x).toList());
}
EOF

# Run it using the Bazel-built VM
bazel-bin/runtime/bin/dartvm /tmp/hello.dart
# Output should be:
# Hello from Bazel-built dartvm!
# [1, 4, 9]
```

### 4. Running Dart Scripts with `bazel run`
We support running Dart scripts directly inside the Bazel sandbox using `bazel run` (thanks to the `dart_binary` rule):

```bash
bazel run //tools/bazel/dart:test_hello -- --verbose
```

## 🤝 Coordination Protocol (How We Work)

To prevent communication breakdowns and avoid merge collisions (especially when multiple AI agents are working concurrently):

1.  **Scan the Backlog:** Always read [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md) first. Look for `[PENDING]` tasks.
2.  **Claim a Task:** Before editing any code, post a "Soft Claim" by changing the task status to `[IN_PROGRESS]`, adding your Owner ID, and committing [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md) first to lock the task.
3.  **Log Your Session:** Document your progress session-by-session in [STATUS.md](STATUS.md). Update the **"Cross-agent notes"** at the top of [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) for live claims and handoffs.
4.  **Report SDK Defects:** If you discover a non-hermetic script or packaging defect in the upstream SDK, document it as a numbered issue in [todo_issues/](todo_issues/) following the protocol in [todo_issues/README.md](todo_issues/README.md) *before* implementing a workaround.

## 🛠️ Developer Workflow & Tooling

### 1. Branching & PR Workflow (No Direct Commits to `bazel`)
*   The `bazel` branch is our main development target. **Do not commit directly to `bazel`.**
*   Create a feature branch for your task: `git checkout -b task-037-cleanup bazel`
*   Push your branch and submit a GitHub Pull Request targeting `bazel`.
*   **Never push to the remote `bazel` branch without explicit human approval.**

### 2. Formatting & Linting (Buildifier)
We enforce standard Starlark formatting and linting repository-wide.
*   **Automated Gate:** A pre-commit hook is active. On a fresh clone, activate it via:
    ```bash
    ln -sf ../../tools/bazel/hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit
    ```
    This hook automatically runs `buildifier --lint=fix` on any staged `BUILD.bazel` or `.bzl` files.
*   **Manual Check:** You can audit formatting and lints manually:
    ```bash
    # Check formatting and warnings without editing
    buildifier --mode=check --lint=warn path/to/BUILD.bazel
    
    # Apply automatic fixes
    buildifier --lint=fix path/to/BUILD.bazel
    ```

### 3. Programmatic Edits (Buildozer)
For scripted, bulk edits to BUILD files, use `buildozer`:
```bash
# Inspect dependencies of a target
buildozer 'print deps' //runtime/bin:dartvm

# Add a dependency
buildozer 'add deps //some:lib' //runtime/bin:dartvm
```

## 🗺️ Directory Map

Only the following active files and directories are maintained in `docs/bazel-migration/`. All historical scoping and design documents have been pruned and are preserved in the **Git history**.

*   [README.md](README.md) — This file. Entry point and developer guide.
*   [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md) — The active backlog and coordination board.
*   [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) — The living session-by-session progress tracker.
*   [UPSTREAM_CANDIDATES.md](UPSTREAM_CANDIDATES.md) — List of non-Bazel fixes to be upstreamed to `main`.
*   [generate_backlog_graph.dart](generate_backlog_graph.dart) — Script to regenerate the dependency graph in `BACKLOG.md`.
*   [todo_issues/](todo_issues/) — Directory containing open, unresolved SDK-internal issues.
