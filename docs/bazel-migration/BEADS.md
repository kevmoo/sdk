# Task Tracking with Beads — Setup & Workflow

Bazel-migration tasks live in **beads** (`bd`), a Dolt-backed issue tracker —
**not** in a checked-in file. [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md) / [BACKLOG_HISTORY.md](BACKLOG_HISTORY.md)
are *generated* from it (see [gen_board_from_beads.dart](gen_board_from_beads.dart)).

The beads database is **not** in the git tree. It rides on the `refs/dolt/data`
side ref of the **`kevmoo/sdk` fork** (not the upstream `dart.googlesource.com`
remote), so it is carried by the fork, recovered with `bd`, and never lost as
long as nobody force-pushes it.

## Learning the `bd` workflow (general)

The general `bd` workflow (`bd ready` / `create` / `show` / `close`, dependency
graph, compaction survival) is documented by beads' own **skill**. Install it
once per machine — either:

- **Plugin**: `/plugin marketplace add steveyegge/beads && /plugin install beads`, or
- **SessionStart hook**: `bd setup claude` (runs `bd prime` to inject context).

Run `bd prime` anytime for the AI-optimized workflow cheat-sheet.

## First-time setup on a new machine (e.g. the Mac side)

Nothing beads-related is in the git tree except this doc and the generated board
(`.beads/`, the exclude rules, and the remote config are all local/per-clone),
so a fresh clone needs three steps:

```bash
# 1. Install the tools
brew install beads dolt           # beads may need a tap — see github.com/steveyegge/beads

# 2. Let git authenticate to GitHub over HTTPS non-interactively
gh auth setup-git                 # uses the gh token as a git credential helper

# 3. Recover the task DB from the fork (clones refs/dolt/data)
bd init --prefix sdk --remote git+https://github.com/kevmoo/sdk.git

bd count        # should list the tasks (verifies recovery)
bd ready        # actionable tasks
```

## Daily workflow

```bash
bd ready                                  # unblocked tasks
bd blocked                                # tasks waiting on prerequisites
bd show <id>                              # full task context
bd update <id> --claim                    # claim + set in_progress
bd close <id> --reason "..."              # complete a task

# After any task change, regenerate the board and push the DB:
tools/sdks/dart-sdk/bin/dart docs/bazel-migration/gen_board_from_beads.dart
bd dolt push                              # ship the DB to the fork
git add docs/bazel-migration/BACKLOG.md docs/bazel-migration/BACKLOG_HISTORY.md  # commit the board
```

## Gotchas (learned the hard way — don't relearn these)

- **Use `git+https://`, never `git+ssh://`** for the dolt remote. The ssh URL
  triggers a `gnome-ssh-askpass` GUI popup and hangs; https authenticates
  silently via the `gh` credential helper.
- The dolt remote `bd dolt push` targets **must be named `origin`** (a remote
  named anything else is silently ignored → "No remote is configured").
- The DB lives on the **`kevmoo/sdk` fork**, not the upstream `origin`
  (`dart.googlesource.com`), which is read-only and has no beads data.
- **Never force-push** the dolt remote — a normal push only adds and can't lose
  history; a force-push is the only way to destroy it.
- **Auto-push is inert** in embedded mode (no background process), so `bd dolt
  push` is a **manual** step. Local `.beads/` history is always safe
  (`auto-commit=on`); the fork is the durable off-machine copy.
- `.beads/` is gitignored and local — it is never committed.
