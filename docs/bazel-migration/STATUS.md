# Bazel migration — status

> **Not an `issue_NNNNN` file.** This is the living progress tracker for the
> GN+Ninja → Bazel migration on branch `kevmoo/bazel`. It lives
> here because `docs/bazel-migration/` is where this work stream keeps its durable,
> reviewable artifacts. The `issue_*.md` files are *discovered SDK improvements*;
> this file is *where the migration itself stands*.
>
> **Keep this current.** Update it at the end of any session that changes the
> migration's state — same discipline as filing an `issue_*.md`. The plan of
> record is `DESIGN.md` (§4.1 molecules, §4.2 phases); this doc maps progress
> onto it.

## 🤝 Cross-agent notes / open handoffs

> **The live coordination surface.** More than one agent works this branch (no realtime
> channel — git is the bus). Read this block FIRST on arrival and update it LAST before you
> stop. It is distinct from the per-session log below: this holds only what is **open right
> now** — active claims + unresolved handoffs. When an item is resolved, delete it (the
> per-session entry preserves the history). Keep it short. See `README.md` → "operational
> rules" for the fetch-rebase-before-editing protocol.

**Open handoffs / residuals:**
- **Blocked on NDK for TASK_004**: Android cross-compilation target `android_arm64` requires the Android NDK to be installed on the host or `download_android_deps` checked out.

**Active claims (who is editing what right now):**
- `[none]`

Session 124 — **(jetski) Completed sdk-oce: Wired up Kernel Worker JIT/AOT snapshots.**
- **Wired up `kernel_worker` JIT Snapshot**: Replaced the placeholder `filegroup` for `kernel_worker` in `utils/bazel/BUILD.bazel` with a `dart_app_jit_snapshot` rule, configuring it to use `kernel_worker.dart` and the JIT VM (`//runtime/bin:dartvm`) with `--help` training arguments.
- **Wired up `kernel_worker_dill`**: Replaced the placeholder `filegroup` for `kernel_worker_dill` as it is now automatically emitted by the `dart_app_jit_snapshot` macro as its stage-1 kernel compile.
- **Wired up `kernel_worker_files_stamp`**: Replaced the placeholder `filegroup` with a `genrule` that touches a stamp file, matching the GN `create_timestamp_file` behavior.
- **Verified Build and Training**: Successfully built all three targets using Bazel, confirming that the JIT training run executes cleanly and outputs the expected help text.
- **Ensured Code Quality**: Formatted and linted `utils/bazel/BUILD.bazel` using `buildifier` to ensure 100% compliance.

Session 123 — **(jetski) Completed sdk-7nj: Migrated and stabilized FFI C++ unit tests under Bazel sandboxed execution.**
- **Successfully Migrated to `cc_test`**: Converted the host-runnable, self-contained FFI unit test binary `run_ffi_unit_tests_x64_linux` into a native Bazel `cc_test` target, making it fully discoverable and cacheable.
- **Resolved Sandboxed Header Dependencies**: Modified the translator to automatically inject hand-authored header-only targets (`//runtime/vm:headers`, `//runtime/platform:headers`, `//runtime/include:headers`) into the FFI unit tests, resolving all missing VM and platform header errors in the sandbox.
- **Resolved C++ Include Puzzle (`ffi_cc_includes`)**: Solved the C++ unity-build inclusion pattern (where `unit_test_custom_zone.cc` includes other `.cc` files) by dynamically generating a helper `cc_library` target `ffi_cc_includes` and putting the included `.cc` files in its `hdrs` (preventing double compilation and duplicate linker symbol errors).
- **Staged Runtime Expectation Files**: Appended a new `ffi_unit_test_expectations` `filegroup` to the hand-authored `runtime/vm/BUILD.bazel` to glob all `.expect` files, and updated the translator to inject it into the `data` attribute of the FFI tests, mounting them in the sandbox at runtime.
- **Implemented Transitive `testonly` Propagation**: Solved Bazel's strict `testonly` dependency constraints by implementing a generic, fixed-point transitive `testonly` propagation pre-pass in the translator. This automatically marks all grouping and root targets as `testonly = True` if they depend on a test.
- **Fixed Cross-Compilation Architecture Leakage**: Fixed a quote-stripping bug in the `rules.bzl` wrappers (`cc_library`, `cc_binary`, `cc_test`) that prevented detecting explicit architecture defines. Updated the translator's cross-target detection to treat any target with an explicit `TARGET_ARCH_*` define as a cross target, forcing it to depend on `dart_mode_no_arch` and completely preventing host architecture leakage during multi-architecture builds.
- **Verified 100% Green E2E**: Verified that `bazel test //runtime/bin/ffi_unit_test:run_ffi_unit_tests_x64_linux` passes 100% green and is cached successfully. Verified that the grouping target `bazel build //runtime/bin/ffi_unit_test:run_ffi_unit_tests` builds all 20 cross-compiled sibling targets cleanly with zero errors.

Session 122 — **(Antigravity) Migrated and stabilized the dart2wasm unit test suite under Bazel sandboxed execution.**
- **Fully Resolved Wasm Sandboxed Executions**: Solved all remaining sandboxing, CFE package config resolution, and SDK source mapping issues for the entire `dart2wasm` unit test suite, making all 10 unit test cases 100% green.
- **Fixed Subprocess Package Injections**: Injected `--packages=${Platform.packageConfig}` into the subprocess compiler invocations within both `ir_test.dart` and `partition_test.dart`. This ensures that CFE compilations executed in subprocesses can hermetically resolve `package:expect` under Bazel sandboxed execution.
- **Updated WAT Expectations**: Regenerated and updated all WebAssembly text representation (`.wat`) expectation files across the entire `ir_tests/` suite using `dart pkg/dart2wasm/test/ir_test.dart -w` on the host, fully aligning them with the newly merged `dev` branch compiler output.
- **Cleaned and Verified 100% Green**: Verified that the entire `tests_vm_release` test target (`bazel test @dart_tests//pkg/dart2wasm:tests_vm_release`) runs and passes **100% successfully** (all 10 test cases green). Satisfied all code quality gates by removing diagnostic prints, and ensuring perfect `dart format` and `dart analyze` compliance across all modified files.

Session 121 — **(Antigravity) Merged upstream Version 3.13.0-178.0.dev and updated merge skill to prefer dev branch.**
- **Merged Upstream Dev Release**: Successfully merged commit `05243f181c214868e0f660d72c089ebbe90437f7` (`Version 3.13.0-178.0.dev`) into our local `bazel` branch. The merge completed cleanly without any conflicts.
- **Synchronized Dependencies**: Ran `gclient sync` to align sub-repositories and regenerate package configurations.
- **Updated Merge Documentation**: Updated [.agents/skills/merge_main_to_bazel.md](file:///.agents/skills/merge_main_to_bazel.md) to strongly encourage and default to merging from the `dev` branch (`origin/dev`) rather than `origin/main` to leverage full CI validation and minimize regression risks.
- **Verified Build & Tests**: Verified that the Dart VM target (`//runtime/bin:dartvm`) builds 100% green under the newly merged dev version, and that all Bazel linter unit tests and headless Wasm integration tests (`corelib/list_test`, `language/abstract_class_test`) pass successfully.

Session 120 — **(jetski) Completed TASK_037: Cleaned up migration documentation and legacy instructions.**
- **Deleted Legacy Files**: Removed 14 outdated/historical files and the entire `deep_dives/` directory from the working tree (relying on Git history for their preservation), reducing clutter and search noise.
- **Modernized README.md**: Rewrote the entry-point documentation to serve as a clean, self-contained "Getting Started" and "Developer Guide". Prioritized the most critical info (Prerequisites, Build Commands, and a VM Smoke Test) at the very top.
- **Integrated Tooling & Run Docs**: Merged the useful parts of `bazel_tooling.md` and `bazel_run_instructions.md` into the new `README.md` and deleted the old files.
- **Updated Backlog & Status**: Marked TASK_037 as `[COMPLETED]` in `BACKLOG.md` and regenerated the Mermaid dependency graph.

Session 119 — **(jetski) Completed TASK_040: Implement `bazel run` support for running Dart scripts.**
- **Implemented `dart_binary` Rule**: Created a custom `dart_binary` executable Bazel rule in `tools/bazel/dart/defs.bzl` that packages the prebuilt Dart VM, transitive package dependencies, and command-line arguments into a runfiles-executable bash script.
- **Created Runfiles Package Config Staging**: Staged the package map at `tools/bazel/dart/package_config.json` inside the output tree via `runfiles_package_config` target. This mirrors the `../../../` depth required by dynamic package URIs inside the runfiles directory, resolving package imports.
- **Unblocked macOS Build (Firefox Bypass)**: Bypassed remote Firefox downloads on non-Linux platforms by returning early from the fetch step in `tools/bazel/third_party.bzl`, allowing macOS builds to proceed warning-free.
- **Verified E2E**: Created a test target `//tools/bazel/dart:test_hello` and verified it compiles, builds, and runs successfully on macOS with parameters (`bazel run //tools/bazel/dart:test_hello -- --verbose`).

Session 118 — **(Antigravity) Enabled Firefox browser testing on macOS and verified end-to-end execution.**
- **Enabled macOS support for Firefox downloader**: Patched the public browser downloader rule in `tools/bazel/third_party.bzl` to support macOS. Rather than failing on non-Linux hosts, it now downloads the Firefox macOS installer package (`.pkg`), expands it using host `pkgutil`, copies `Firefox.app` to the repository root, and generates a relative launcher wrapper script named `firefox`.
- **Addressed PR review feedback**: Improved the macOS downloader implementation by utilizing `find` to recursively locate `Firefox.app` inside the payload (making the extraction path resilient to naming changes). Patched the launcher wrapper script to recursively resolve symlinks via a portable bash loop, ensuring correctness when run under Bazel's runfiles tree.
- **Resolved second round of PR feedback**: Added explicit verification of the extracted `Firefox.app` existence (`repository_ctx.path("Firefox.app").exists`) to fail early and avoid silent errors. Unconditionally printed standard output/error of the copy command to preserve terminal log visibility.
- **Resolved third round of PR feedback**: Unconditionally printed standard output and error for both `pkgutil` and `find` commands to improve debug log visibility during loading/analysis phases.
- **Resolved fourth round of PR feedback**: Explicitly deleted `Firefox.app`, `firefox.pkg`, and `tmp_pkg` before downloading and expanding the package to prevent stale files and directory nesting on re-execution.
- **Verified Firefox E2E testing**: Successfully executed `python3 tools/test.py --bazel -n dart2wasm-firefox language/covariant/callable_class_field_getter_test` before and after all PR fixes, confirming the test suite runs green.

Session 117 — **(jetski) Enabled standard Bazel formatting and linting (Buildifier) repository-wide.**
- **Resolved warnings in defs.bzl**: Removed unused variables (`_PACKAGE_CONFIG`, `_PACKAGE_CONFIG_FILE`, `_COMPILE_PLATFORM`) and unused parameter `sdk_hash` from macros. Added buildifier disable comments for function docstrings on AOT/JIT macros, and sorted all `attrs` dictionaries.
- **Resolved warnings in BUILD files**: Added `alwayslink = True` to 6 hand-authored C++ stub/linkable libraries in `runtime/bin/BUILD.bazel` to fix `no-hdrs-no-alwayslink` warning. Sorted `select` dictionary keys in `runtime/platform/BUILD.bazel`, `runtime/bin/BUILD.bazel`, and `build/config/BUILD.bazel`. Moved `tools/gn.py` out of glob in root `BUILD.bazel`. Added disable comments for `alwayslink-with-hdrs` in `runtime/engine/BUILD.bazel` and `platform-specific-binaries` in `build/config/sanitizers/BUILD.bazel`.
- **Added CI Linter Gate**: Created a separate GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/buildifier.yml` to run formatting/linting check on all tracked Bazel files (excluding `third_party` and `gen_targets.bzl`).
- **Added Agent Linter Gate**: Updated `.agents/rules/code_quality_gates.md` with the new Bazel formatting and linting gate.
- **Updated Backlog**: Added `TASK_039` to `BACKLOG.md` and regenerated the dependency graph.

Session 116 — **(jetski) Completed TASK_036 (cc_library stubs cleanup) and resolved review feedback.**
- **Completed TASK_036 (cc_library stubs cleanup)**: Audited all remaining placeholder `cc_library` targets in the repository that do not contain C++ source code. Converted them to `filegroup` targets across `sdk/BUILD.bazel`, `utils/BUILD.bazel`, `utils/kernel-service/BUILD.bazel`, and `utils/bazel/BUILD.bazel`. Removed unnecessary `rules_cc` load statements.
- **Resolved Review Feedback**: Rewrote the stale comment in `utils/kernel-service/BUILD.bazel` to correctly describe the `copy_kernel-service_snapshot` target as a `filegroup` using `srcs`, satisfying code review warnings from `@gemini-code-assist`.
- **Verified E2E Build and Queries**: Successfully built `//sdk:create_sdk` in the worktree (completing all 6,008 actions green), verifying that the new filegroup stubs are fully compatible with their filegroup/genrule consumers. Verified that `bazel fetch //...` wildcard query finishes successfully warning-free.

Session 115 — **(jetski) Fixed path duplication bug for test helpers, investigated browser testing, and added package sync investigation task.**
- **Fixed Path Duplication Bug**: Staged a fix in `generate_test_targets.dart` to correctly strip the suite name from the destination path of auxiliary files, preventing duplicate nesting and resolving compile-time errors in split multitests.
- **Investigated Browser Testing**: Found that browser testing under Bazel is currently not runnable due to the absence of HTTP server infrastructure in the sandboxed test executor (`run_single_test.dart`) and dummy URLs in target metadata. Reverted experimental execution changes.
- **Added TASK_038 to Backlog**: Added a pending task to investigate migrating Dart package dependency syncing to Bazel, and regenerated the backlog graph.

Session 114 — **(jetski) Completed PR #9 feedback, added Python formatting quality gate, and cleaned up resource limits.**
- **Fixed PR #9 feedback**: Aligned the `subDirToPkgDir` key population logic in `generate_test_targets.dart` to match `flatName` lookup by stripping the `custom-` prefix, resolving package lookup failures.
- **Synchronized and Cleaned workspace**: Checked out `bazel` branch and reset to `kevmoo/bazel` to sync all upstream merged PRs. Force-removed the completed `cl508425_wasm_fix` worktree and deleted local branches `r1-task-033`, `r2-r3-task-034`, and `cl-508425-type-opt`.
- **Enforced Python Formatting**: Added a new Python Formatting Gate to `code_quality_gates.md` requiring `yapf` formatting from `depot_tools`. Formatted all 21 modified/created Python files in-place using `yapf` and committed/pushed style changes.
- **Reverted Bazel Resource Limits**: Removed `--jobs=4` and memory limits from `.bazelrc` to allow Bazel to scale to all workstation cores.
- **Verified E2E**: Executed E2E browser test run `tools/test.py --bazel -n dart2wasm-chrome corelib/list_test` which compiled and passed cleanly.
- **Updated Backlog**: Added `TASK_037` to BACKLOG.md to audit and clean up migration documentation and legacy instructions, and regenerated the Mermaid dependency graph.

Session 113 — **(jetski) Rebased branches and verified compiler covariance fix under Bazel.**
- **Rebased Task Branches**: Rebased both `r1-task-033` and `r2-r3-task-034` onto the updated remote `bazel` branch (which includes PR #6 and PR #7), resolving all backlog and status merge conflicts cleanly.
- **Fixed Dynamic VM Snapshot selection**: Restored the `select()` conditional block for `copy_dart2wasm_snapshot` in `sdk/BUILD.bazel` to dynamically package the product vs non-product compiler snapshot. Verified the SDK compiles successfully in both configurations via `bazel build //sdk:create_sdk` and `bazel build --//build/config:dart_product=true //sdk:create_sdk`.
- **Restored Corrupted ICU directory**: Fixed a circular symlink cycle inside the main repository's untracked `third_party/icu/source` directory by force-syncing the dependency using `/usr/local/google/home/kevmoo/github/depot_tools/gclient sync -f`.
- **Verified E2E Browser Testing and Compiler Covariance Fix**: Rebased the user's local compiler covariance fix branch `cl-508425-type-opt` onto `r2-r3-task-034` and ran `python3 tools/test.py --bazel -n dart2wasm-chrome language/covariant/callable_class_field_getter_test` inside the worktree. The test compiled, loaded chromedriver, and executed green.

Session 112 — **(jetski) Added TASK_036 to backlog based on PR #7 review.**
- **Reviewed PR #7**: Reviewed the changes in PR #7 and identified generalizations for the rest of the migration.
- **Added TASK_036 to Backlog**: Added a new task to audit and convert remaining `cc_library` stubs to `filegroup` or `alias` across the workspace.

Session 111 — **(jetski) Completed TASK_034: Add Chrome/Firefox test configurations to Bazel target generator.**
- **Added Browser Configurations to Target Generator**: Added `wasm_chrome_release`, `wasm_chrome_asserts`, `wasm_chrome_optimized`, `wasm_firefox_release`, `wasm_firefox_asserts`, `dart2js_chrome_release`, and `dart2js_firefox_release` configurations to `tools/bazel/dart/generate_test_targets.dart`.
- **Implemented Simplified Relocation Logic**: Refactored the auxiliary file relocation routing loop in `generate_test_targets.dart` to determine the correct suite package directory (`pkgDir`) using the flat unique name of test cases (`_getPkgDirFromFlatName` helper). This cleanly resolves path divergence for multitest split files and browser HTML wrappers, preventing them from leaking into the output root directory.
- **Verified Browser target generation and E2E execution**: Verified that `python3 tools/bazel_browser_test_e2e.py` and `python3 tools/adv_test_wrapper_audit_test.py` execute and pass 100% successfully on the local branch, confirming that HTML wrappers are generated, globbed correctly, and routed properly under the suite `gen_tests/` subdirectories.

Session 110 — **(worker_4) Completed and Isolated TASK_033: Fix SDK packaging VM product mode configuration mismatch.**
- **Isolated R1 changes**: Created local branch `r1-task-033` and discarded all changes outside of R1 (specifically `pkg/test_runner/bin/run_single_test.dart`, `tools/bazel/dart/generate_test_targets.dart`, `tools/bazel/dart/test_rules.bzl`, `tools/test.py`, and `tools/test_wrapper_test.py`).
- **Verified Build VM target**: Successfully executed `bazel build //runtime/bin:dartvm`.
- **Verified Build SDK target**: Successfully executed `bazel build //sdk:create_sdk`.
- **Verified VM Tests**: Ran `python3 tools/test.py --bazel -n vm-release-x64 corelib/list_test` which passed cleanly.
- **Updated BACKLOG.md**: Marked TASK_033 completed and regenerated dependency graph.

Session 109 — **(jetski) Resolved workspace-wide wildcard target evaluation and package loading errors.**
- **Fixed Empty Glob Loading Error**: Corrected `tools/bazel/BUILD.bazel` to only export `parse_deps.py` after the deletion of the `out_of_band/` directory, resolving package loading errors during wildcard scans.
- **Added Upstream Ignores to .bazelignore**: Appended `third_party/boringssl/src`, `third_party/perfetto/src`, `third_party/cpu_features/src`, `third_party/emsdk/bazel`, and `third_party/icu/source` to `.bazelignore` to prevent Bazel from scanning unignored upstream build files.
- **Converted wrappers to filegroups**: Converted mock/stub/wrapper `cc_library` targets (like `//:dart2js`, `//utils/ddc:ddc_canary_test`, etc.) to `filegroup` targets in `BUILD.bazel` and `utils/ddc/BUILD.bazel` to prevent CcInfo provider validation errors.
- **Resolved DevTools Staging Path Conflict**: Modified `build_devtools` and `copy_prebuilt_devtools` to write to unique output directories under the `sdk` package. Appended a custom `copy_directory` Starlark rule to `tools/bazel/dart/defs.bzl` and introduced a `//sdk:copy_devtools` target to stage the selected DevTools output dynamically.
- **Verified Build**: Confirmed `bazel fetch //...` completes successfully, and both `bazel build //sdk:create_sdk` and `bazel build //runtime/bin:dartvm` build 100% green.

Session 108 — **(jetski) Fixed dart2wasm compiler snapshot product compatibility mismatch.**
- **Identified and Fixed Snapshot Product Mismatch**: Resolved a test failure where executing dart2wasm tests in Bazel would crash because `dartaotruntime` (always product mode) mismatched the compiler snapshot `dart2wasm_product.snapshot` (staged as non-product release mode).
- **Updated BUILD.bazel**: Modified `copy_dart2wasm_snapshot` in `sdk/BUILD.bazel` to always source the product snapshot (`//utils/dart2wasm:dart2wasm_product_snapshot`).
- **Verified Tests**: Confirmed that `python3 tools/test.py --bazel -n wasm-unittest-asserts-linux tests/web/wasm/simd/simd_smoke_test.dart` compiles and passes successfully.
