# Dart SDK Bazel Migration: Agent Backlog & Coordination Board

This is the single source of truth for the remaining migration work stream. It is designed to be read, claimed, and updated by autonomous AI agents during long-runtime sessions, and reviewed by human researchers.

> 🚨 **AGENT PROTOCOL (Mandatory)**:
> 1. **Scan**: Read this file FIRST on arrival. Check for open `[PENDING]` tasks.
> 2. **Claim**: Before editing, post a "Soft Claim" by changing the task status to `[IN_PROGRESS]`, adding your Agent ID (e.g., `[jetski-3]`), and committing this file first to lock the task.
> 3. **Verify**: Run the exact `Verification Command` in the task block.
> 4. **Update**: Once verified green, update the task status to `[COMPLETED]`, check the success criteria boxes, append the git commit hash, and update the session log in `STATUS.md`.
> 5. **Handoff**: Release your claim. Never edit a task claimed by another agent.

## 📋 Active Backlog

### 🎯 [TASK_001] Dynamic Package Dependency Mapping
- **Status**: `[COMPLETED]`
- **Prerequisites**: None
- **Owner**: `[jetski]`
- **Commit**: `[4bbcd110701]`
- **Target Files**:
  - `tools/bazel/dart/generate_test_targets.dart`
- **Description**:
  Implement dynamic package dependency mapping inside the test target generator. For any test target generated under `pkg/<package_name>`, the generator must dynamically inject `@//:dart_pkg_<package_name>` into its Bazel `data` dependencies. This ensures package library files and their complete transitive closures are staged inside the hermetic sandbox, resolving missing imports during JIT VM test runs and establishing perfect cache invalidation boundaries.
- **Verification Command**:
  ```bash
  python3 tools/test.py --bazel pkg/smith
  ```
- **Success Criteria**:
  - [x] `generate_test_targets.dart` dynamically adds `@//:dart_pkg_<pkgName>` to test targets generated for `pkg/` subdirectories.
  - [x] Hardcoded package mappings in `dataDeps` are minimized to baseline frameworks.
  - [x] Package tests execute cleanly JIT inside the hermetic sandbox and changes to `pkg/smith/lib/` correctly invalidate the test cache.

### 🎯 [TASK_002] Pre-Computed Package Import Mapping (Fine-Grained Opt-in)
- **Status**: `[COMPLETED]`
- **Prerequisites**: None
- **Owner**: `[jetski]`
- **Commit**: `[dynamic]`
- **Target Files**:
  - `tools/bazel/dart/generate_test_targets.dart`
  - `tools/bazel/dart/gen_test_imports.dart`
- **Description**:
  Provide a high-performance developer tool to generate a static dependency map `test_imports.json` for huge packages like `pkg/analyzer`. Upgraded `generate_test_targets.dart` must consume this pre-computed JSON file to output individual fine-grained test targets with surgically precise file-level `data` dependencies, unlocking ultra-granular Bazel caching within packages without scanning overhead at Bazel runtime.
- **Verification Command**:
  ```bash
  python3 tools/test.py --bazel pkg/analyzer/test/dart/analysis/analysis_context_test.dart
  ```
- **Success Criteria**:
  - [x] A high-performance CLI tool `gen_test_imports.dart` is created to recursively parse imports and output `test_imports.json`.
  - [x] `generate_test_targets.dart` detects `test_imports.json` in package directories and dynamically outputs individual `sh_test` targets for each test case.
  - [x] Modifying a single library file under `pkg/analyzer/lib/` only invalidates the specific, transitively importing JIT VM test targets inside the Bazel sandbox.

  ```
- **Success Criteria**:
  - [ ] Sanitizer configurations compile without linker errors.

- **Status**: `[PENDING]`
- **Prerequisites**: None
- **Owner**: `[none]`
- **Commit**: `[none]`
- **Target Files**:
  - `sdk/BUILD.bazel`
- **Description**:
  Resolve the remaining minor packaging stubs in the SDK assembly:
  1. Implement `dart2bytecode` AOT snapshot compilation and staging.
  2. Implement dynamic compilation of DevTools from source under Bazel instead of copying prebuilt assets via `copy_prebuilt_devtools` (if `build_devtools_from_sources` is enabled).
- **Verification Command**:
  ```bash
  /usr/local/google/home/kevmoo/bin/bazel build //sdk:create_sdk
  ```
- **Success Criteria**:
  - [ ] `dart2bytecode` snapshot is built and staged successfully under `dart-sdk/bin/snapshots/`.
  - [ ] DevTools builds hermetically from source when required.

### 🎯 [TASK_009] Relocate and Migrate Worktree Symlinker to Dart
- **Status**: `[PENDING]`
- **Prerequisites**: None
- **Owner**: `[none]`
- **Commit**: `[none]`
- **Target Files**:
  - `tools/bazel/dart/setup_worktree_links.sh`
  - `tools/setup_worktree_links.dart`
- **Description**:
  Relocate the git worktree helper script `setup_worktree_links.sh` from `tools/bazel/dart/` to the root of the `tools/` directory to make it a prominent, standard tool, and migrate its bash scripting logic to a robust, cross-platform Dart CLI tool (`tools/setup_worktree_links.dart`). The new Dart tool should recursively resolve the parent git checkout path using git worktree metadata, verify directories, and safely establish symlinks for untracked gclient dependencies (`third_party/`, `buildtools/`, prebuilt SDKs) across all supported platforms (Linux, macOS, and Windows).
- **Verification Command**:
  ```bash
  dart tools/setup_worktree_links.dart
  ```
- **Success Criteria**:
  - [ ] The tool is relocated and migrated to a standalone Dart CLI program at `tools/setup_worktree_links.dart`.
  - [ ] It successfully resolves parent git checkouts and establishes symlinks under secondary git worktrees.
  - [ ] It handles file existences, skips tracked configurations safely, and works cleanly on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

### 🎯 [TASK_010] Non-Flattened Direct Import Mapping for Test Caching
- **Status**: `[PENDING]`
- **Prerequisites**: None
- **Owner**: `[none]`
- **Commit**: `[none]`
- **Target Files**:
  - `tools/bazel/dart/generate_test_targets.dart`
  - `tools/bazel/dart/gen_test_imports.dart`
- **Description**:
  Refactor `test_imports.json` from storing fully-flattened transitive dependency lists to storing a minimal, non-flattened graph of **direct local imports/exports** for each file in the package (tests and libs). Upgrade `generate_test_targets.dart` to load this direct import graph and dynamically compute the transitive closure for each test using a memoized, cycle-safe Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal at generation time. This shrinks the JSON database sizes by ~95% (from 3.4MB to <150KB) and keeps Git history clean by ensuring changes to library imports only touch a single line in the JSON file.
- **Verification Command**:
  ```bash
  python3 tools/test.py --bazel pkg/analyzer/test/dart/analysis/analysis_context_test.dart
  ```
- **Success Criteria**:
  - [ ] `gen_test_imports.dart` is updated to only write out direct local imports for each file in `test_imports.json`, resulting in a vastly smaller JSON size.
  - [ ] `generate_test_targets.dart` successfully implements a cycle-safe DFS with memoization to resolve closures in under 50ms.
  - [ ] Running tests via `tools/test.py --bazel` yields identical dynamic sandboxed targets and passes completely green.
